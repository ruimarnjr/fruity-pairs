## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main/Master Branch
  - Once the main/master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

### Forking

- Go to the GitHub repository that you want to fork. This is the repository that you wish to create a personal copy of.
- On the top-right corner of the repository page, you'll find a button labeled "Fork". Click on the "Fork" button to initiate the forking process. This will create a duplicate copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
- GitHub will process the forking request, creating a separate copy of the repository within your account. Once the forking process is complete, you will be redirected to the newly created forked repository.

### Cloning 

- On the GitHub repository page, click on the green "Code" button located towards the top-right of the page. This will display a dropdown menu. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repository's URL to your clipboard.
- Open your preferred terminal or command prompt on your local machine. Ensure you have Git installed and configured properly.
- Use the cd command in the terminal to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository into your "Documents" folder, you would use the command: cd Documents.
- In the terminal, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL you copied in step 1.
- Press Enter to execute the git clone command. Git will connect to the remote repository and download a copy of the entire repository, including all its files, commit history, and branches, to your local machine.
- Once the cloning process is complete, you will see a message indicating that the repository has been successfully cloned to your local machine. You can now navigate to the cloned repository using the terminal.
